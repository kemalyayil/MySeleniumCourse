        Q: What are various ways of locating an element in Selenium?

            ID, className, tagName, CSS Selector, XPath

        Q: Why I cannot find element?

            -The element might be changed
            -There is a wait issue(page is not fully load)
            -There might be an iframe

        Q: What is the difference between single slash(/) and double slash(//)?

            Absolute xpath starts with single slash ( / ), starting from root element and all the way to the element.
            Relative xpath starts with double slash ( // ), starting selection matching anywhere in the document.

        Q: Difference between close() and quit() command?
            close() to close current window, quit() will quit the browser

        Q: Difference between xpath and css selector?
            XPath can go backward and forward, CSS can only go forward
            XPath can locate element by text, CSS cannot
            CSS is faster, XPath have more combinations

        Q:  How you handle js alerts?
            • If the alert on the browser comes from JavaScript, we use the Alert class.

        Q: findElement vs findElements?
           • FindElement > this method returns first WebElement !
                o gives Exception if the element not found
           • FindElements > returns List <WebElement>;
                o does not give Exception if the element not found as a result list has null values

        Q: Implicit Wait vs Explicit Wait?
            Implicit wait is a wait which waits for a specified time while locating an element before throwing
            “NoSuchElementException”. As by default selenium tries to find elements immediately without any wait. So, it is good to use implicit wait. This wait applied to all elements of the current driver instance.

            Explicit wait is a wait which is applied to a particular webelement until the ExpectedCondition specified is met.
